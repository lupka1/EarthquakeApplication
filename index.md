## Welcome to Earthquake app

The application has been created by IT students, because of two reasons. First of all we _wanted_ to get familiar with one of the most popular JavaScript framework - Vue.js and we want to avoid earthquake as much as possible.

Using Github Pages we'd like to briefly present the Earthquake app and encourage to use it and develope with us.


### How does it work?

The application presents places, where the earthquake take place lately. User can select if it's in:
- last hour
- last week
- past months

Once one of the option is selected, the information about earthquale is displayed on the screen. All places are marked on the map. Below, there is list with locations and additionaly value of magnitude.
