## Welcome to Earthquake app

The application has been created by IT students, because of two reasons. First of all we _wanted_ to get familiar with one of the most popular JavaScript framework - Vue.js and we want to avoid earthquake as much as possible.

Using Github Pages we'd like to briefly present the Earthquake app and encourage to use it and develope with us.


### How does it work?

The application presents places, where the earthquake take place lately. User can select if it's in:
- last hour
- last week
- past months

Once one of the option is selected, the information about earthquake is displayed on the screen. All places are marked on the map. Below, there is list with locations and additionaly value of magnitude.

### Basic use case

The main goal of this project is to give a clear picture, where earthquake(s) took place in the defined period of time. Having this information user can see, which places can be currently dangerous.

When user opens the [application](https://stiepek.github.io/EarthquakeApp/) main page is displayed.

There are 3 buttons, by clicking one of them, user will select from which period of time earthquakes will be displayed.
Let's use 'Significiant earthquakes(last 7 days)'. Now on the top of the page the map with points is displayed. Each point represents one earthquake. Below there is a list of all earthquakes: where it was and value of magnitude.

If someone is not familiar with magnitude, clicking 'Legend' button will display more information.
